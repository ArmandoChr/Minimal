My Portfolio with varying projects. Most coding/model projects are continously changed so see time stamp on what is to be downloaded. Contact me for the up to date models if I have forgot to update them here.

Make note that STATA files require depository to be selected of folder with .dta file. Available for download too, always on line 1 in STATA .do file so change to your own folder

Python Projects are work in progress and older versions are viewable here scattered around because I was lazy when I first made my Github. They will be organized when more projects are completed

Coursework are written analysis that were awarded a 1st

Excel models are being changed all the time. Format used is that of Martin Shkreli which was accessed from his livestreams on Twitch and Youtube.
